- üëã Hi from GenerativeAI4Finance team!! You have been using OpenAI & chatGPT for Text, & Audio. How cool is to build a "Generative AI platform for Finance" from scratch!
  Kind of Jarvis from Iron Man exclusively for Finance. Jarvis Avatar for users, IT professionals, Bankers and everyone needing or using Finance.
  You read it right.
  Totally from scratch - Right from a foundational model to different forms of prompts, co-pilots,
  tools It's Generative AI for use cases in Lending, Investment Banking, Trading, Banking as a Service and so on.
  And later expanding to Wealth management & Asset Management. We will build our own technology stack, tools from scratch.
- üëÄ Let's collect use cases, set of tools, AI infra already available and so on.
- üå± Let's start from a "Hello World" but then build something remarkable for the World.
- üíûÔ∏è Let your imagination and coding skills come together. Start from the use cases you think should be built. Think of Co-Pilots for various roles.

  # Generative AI Illustrative Architecture
  This is not complete but just examplary. Certain improvements need to be done and are known.
  These may be done in upcoming versions.

        - "Which stocks had the highest spread today"
    - AI Co-pilot suggesting trading signals
  ### IT & Support
    - Natural language Queries for your knowledge base from JIRA, Sharepoint, Confluence, Notion or other
    - Convert your emails to be searchable
    - Troubleshoot production issues with queries such as "What was the latency in the Order Management System at 10.30:04"
      Or "Has there been a similar issue in last 10 days where the trade failed"

  ### Advanced Use Cases (Vaayushop team has been working on some of these in context of Lending and is in initial stages of designing & prototyping) 
    - Search in humanized languages on your organizational data(Databases, Sharepoint, Conflences)
    - Monetize your systems for lending or to other industries.
    - Monetize by creating your own proprietory Large Language Model based on financial and trading news to be used internally or commercialized to external clients
    -  Create your proprietory financial data based foundational model. Like GPT models work on audio text, video - this model works for financial data & decsion making
    - Adapt investment banking systems with Generative AI 4 Finance for Invoice Exchange & Supply chain Finance to create world's most advanced Invoice Exchange. Read Related
